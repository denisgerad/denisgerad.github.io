  <div class="project-title">MERN Messenger Starter</div>
  <p>
    A real-time chat application built as a hands-on exploration of the MERN stack,
    focusing on authentication flows, token handling, and WebSocket-based messaging.
    </p>
  <p>
    The project explores how modern web applications handle live messaging, user presence, and session-based authentication, with a UI inspired by WhatsApp’s dark theme.

  <div class="project-title">Crew-AI (HR Recruiting Prototype)</div>
  <p>
    An AI-powered HR recruiting prototype designed to evaluate how multiple LLM agents
    can collaborate on complex tasks such as CV parsing, candidate scoring,
    and decision-making.
  </p>
  <p>
    The project explores agent orchestration, role-based reasoning, and task delegation
    using CrewAI, while running models locally via Ollama. The focus is on understanding
    agent workflows and decision boundaries rather than building a production ATS.

<div class="project">
  <div class="project-title">AI Agent Prototype</div>
  <p>
    A research-oriented AI agent framework built to study agentic reasoning,
    conversation memory, and dynamic tool selection using locally hosted LLMs.
    The agent can reason over PDFs (RAG), web content, APIs, and conversation history.
  </p>
  <p>
    A key extension of this project is an investigation-first Debug Agent that avoids
    blind code refactoring. Instead, it detects environmental signals (e.g. “works on PC
    but not mobile”), asks clarifying questions, generates verification steps,
    and proposes multiple fix strategies only after validation.
